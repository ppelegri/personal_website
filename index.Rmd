<br> 
I am passionate about the intersection of climate, resilience, and social justice. I am currently a Master's candidate in Environmental Science and Management at the Bren School of UC Santa Barbara. When I'm not working behind a computer, I love leading teen backpacking trips and developing my naturalist skills.
