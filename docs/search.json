      "contents": "\nI started working on climate issues in 2012 when I helped start successful fossil fuel divestment campaigns at Pomona College (where I went to undergrad) and Pitzer College. After exploring other sustainability sectors and graduating in 2015, I found a way to combine social justice and environmental stewardship by helping cities develop equitable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies from 2016 to 2021.\nI am now pursuing a Master’s degree at the Bren School of UCSB, where I am using my background in climate action and multidisciplinary problem solving to advance natural climate solutions.\nMy current projects include helping White Buffalo Land Trust gain financial value from their regenerative farming operation through ecosystem services credits, visualizing a dataset on cookstove use in Ghana for policymakers to interact with, and guiding youth on rite of passage backpacking trips in Yosemite with Back to Earth.\n\n\n\n",
